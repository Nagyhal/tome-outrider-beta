implementation problems

Skittish -- how to flee for more than 1 turn?
Disobedience in general -- how to temporarily alter ai wants?
Mounted Archery -- how to handle archery shooting speed vs movement speed? (possibly the same way as you do mounts)

talent design problems

Master of Brutality -- how can I make it more of an attractive option to 1st level adventurers?
	... what is it for? melee whackers? It's to add APR to help make melee 1-handers feel better ... and disincentivize 2handers, mainly
	the fact you have no mental debuffs in the first tier is a big problem also, which you've tried to mitigate with the hunting horn

There's also a big error in the mount code. Got this by dismounting after reload:

First:

Lua Error: /mod/class/Actor.lua:3010: attempt to index local 'e' (a nil value)
	At [C]:-1 __index
	At /mod/class/Actor.lua:3010 takeHit

And on second try:
