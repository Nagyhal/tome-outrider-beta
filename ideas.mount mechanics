possible solutions to the mount issue:

-> call a separate act routine, given either to the mount or its rider (which would then reference the mount), to act in a specific, limited way 

-> return the mount to the level temporarily to have it act, then shunt it off again and replace it with the player

-> place the mount in the game.entities area and have it act that way

I think to start with I shall use a combination of 1 and 3. I shall create a special "Mount" item upon mounting, that shall then act in an extremely limited way 	when called to.

This methodology however leaves two "mounts" in game to be referenced - the mount Actor that takes damage (and is removed from the level), and the mount Object, an entirely different entity.

The mountAct routine would have to be very heavily specialized toward calling attacks from the off-level mount Actor.
