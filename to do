General
	Fix whatever happens with the minimap
	Implement basic Loyalty mechanics
		-depletion on damage
		-depletion imparts status effects
		-status effects affect mount when both ridden and running free
		-consider how to make the mount rebel once Loyalty is at 0
	Look at alchemist golems for how to provide petes with levelup, etc, dialogs
	Yes I DO have a  mount.
	Should not be able to remain "mounted" when mount is dead
	Display owner's loyalty when controlling the mount

New Talents
	Finish Mounted Acrobatics-
		idea for clinging to underside of the mount and using it as a shield
	Add melee functionality to Howling Arrows, split the talent
	Living Shield- import and polish Beholder's drag code
	Brazen Lunge redesign

Ideas Needed
	A touch-up for the wolf's talents-
		possibly make Fetch a player-controlled ability (maybe via Bestial Dominion)
	Talent trees for the Spider
	Talent trees for the Drake
	Final talent for "Raider" category
	Decide how to fill out Barbarous / Dreadful - maybe Catch could go in Barbarous and Dreadful get some kind of Combined Arms?
	An ability that provides a bonus after using a "command" (party option) on a mount. This also serves a design purpose, that of reinforcing the player's awareness that you can do this sort of thing.

Spider

ideas-------

Sly Senses
	needs a better name.
	or, to better live up to its name
	attack, defense and saves are out of vogue, so an additonal benefit might not be amiss
	also, don't forget to add attack
	+perception that it shares with its owner?
	the bonus would have to be mirrored in Loyal to the Pack
	something crit-related might be cool, along with something detection-related
	probably actually really going to add Cunning as well as Dexterity
Go for the Throat
	reduce cooldown with talent levels (it'll totally be this tree's killer app)
Uncanny Tenacity
	absolutely needs to be jazzed up
	+speed to fit with the power attack theme of this tree
	but then, wolves are not supposed to be too powerful
	but they are supposed to be well balanced
	could have an activated so that Go for the Throat gets a synergistic boost
	yeah, like a bonus against weakened adjacent enemies and also an attack that procs post-threshold
Loyal to the Pack
	provide symmetry to sly senses' new feature
	probably going to add Cunning as well as Willpower
Together, Forever
	define "damage"
Predatory Flanking
	also improve all damage by allies

----Bestial Dominion----

Challenge the Wilds
	Maybe levels in this could reduce the chances of beast's rebellion - %% chance that enemies' attempts to deplete loyalty will be averted, for example, plus a %% chance to regain it or increased regeneration at low Loyalty levels
