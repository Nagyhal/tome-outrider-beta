Outrider beta : What do we need to release?

The basic plan would be to
<>  Cut out some MORE of the crappy talents
<>  Clear out and simplify much of the flavour text
<>  Make the mount / Challenge / etc. experience really cool
<>  Add some very primitive stuff toward choosing a mount encounter from an area--then make them all choose WOLF
<>  Basic disobedience

What the ULTIMATE RELEASE would look like

<>  Millions of amazing mounts, from Elk to Crystal Beasts to Great Wyrms (via a prodigy!)
<>  Multiple other prodigies to choose from
<>  Numerous special artifacts and items
<>  Special flavour text drops
<>  An Outrider settlement you can visit (don't forget your gay lover Sven)
<>  Stables
<>  A special Outrider zone or two -- maybe a starter zone, a "special" zone or encounter, and a higher level zone (Maybe one of the prides could be "overwritten" or given an Outrider variant?)
<>  Roaming Outrider warbands
<>  Really polished, fun, finished talent trees
<>  Complete mounted character tile artwork
