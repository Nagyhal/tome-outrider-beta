Wolf--talent touchup

General
	Make mounts attack.
	To do that, you'll have to make mounts tick energy as usual.
	Make mounts /regen/
	Grant mounting talents sensibly
	Make dismounts properly accept a target, and remove the same from mounting

Sly Senses
	needs a better name.
	or, to better live up to its name
	attack, defense and saves are out of vogue, so an additonal benefit might not be amiss
	also, don't forget to add attack
	+perception that it shares with its owner?
	the bonus would have to be mirrored in Loyal to the Pack
	something crit-related might be cool, along with something detection-related
Go for the Throat
	reduce cooldown with talent levels
	it'll be this tree's killer app
Uncanny Tenacity
	absolutely needs to be jazzed up
	+speed to fit with the power attack theme of this tree
	but then, wolves are not supposed to be too powerful
	but they are supposed to be well balanced
	could have an activated so that Go for the Throat gets a synergistic boost
Loyal to the Pack
	provide symmetry to sly senses' new feature
Together, Forever
	define "damage"
Predatory Flanking
	then all damage by allies
