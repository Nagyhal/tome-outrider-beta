Test:
  I'm actually adding this here just to test if git branch works the way I think it does.
  It's my repository and I can do what I want to! Who cares?

  ☐ Any ideas for Shock Tactics?
  ☐ Any ideas for Beast Aspect?
  ☐ Git : Upload changes meticulously
  ☐ Feigned retreat: better desc
  ☐ Ask DG to get access to the repo back so you can do retrieve this stuff
  ☐ Beast Archery - a sustain timer
  ☐ Beast Archery - disabled on attack
  ☐ Mount block : Prevent re-mounting for a couple of turns after being knocked off
  ☐ Test & refactor the Living Shield
  ☐ Test & refactor Scatter the Unworthy

The remainder of the player talents (2 days):
  ☐ Finish off the resting routine
  ☐ If need be, look into shaders as well as particle effects  
  ☐ Update shared_talent to work with a table
  ☐ Sort out the helper functions and make a preCheckCanMove which includes the mount
  ☐ Think about having messages, as well as penalties, for when you have a 2hander
  ☐ Tune Gruesome Depredation up.
  ☐ Subdue the Beast - a big unknown!
  ☐ Make Unbridled Ferocity really cool
  ☐ Make the mount tile bigger when using Unbridled Ferocity
  ✘ Let 'Em Have It! needs a cleanup, make it the 2nd talent @cancelled (20-06-21 12:39)
  ✔ Your "Rearing Assault" is probably gonna lose its spot though @done (20-06-22 14:43)
  ☐ Now, you will need to look at the Wolf talents and figure out what is wrong with them and what redesigns are possible
  ☐ Wolf (first 4 talents)
  ☐ Wolf (next 4 talents)
  ☐ Feast of Blood : Can you make it last a couple of turns?
  ☐ 
  ☐ Bestial traits : What will they be like? Collect ideas
  ☐ Bestial traits : Make sure they work and think about their implementation. This might be one you keep coming back to, however.
  ☐ Bestial traits : Make it take a half-level of XP to reveal a new one. Do the interface for this (a progress bar on talent? or just %?)
  ☐ I'm collecting a list of difficult problems in the problem file and this would be a good chance to ask DG, minmay, astral
  ☐ At this stage, I also want to add LuaDoc-approved annotations to all of my helper functions, very specific todos, and remove much of the mess.
  ☐ And check / clean up all helper talents again. This will make the next stage that much easier.

Wolf talents :
 ☐ Have a look at EVERYTHING and figure out what you want to change
 ☐ Refactor, reapproach and reattack anything that's bugging you
 ☐ Think about a completely new kind of communicatior design pattern (superloads & an id table that is continually refreshed/deleted)

Talent code polish-up (2 days):
  ☐ Check that things like "range" are good for the AI to use
  ☐ is_melee; requires_target; speed; damDesc
  ☐ etc!

Playtest ^e^ (3 days):
  ☐ Have fun. Get it out there!
  ☐ Icons re-touch as you do this.

Big problems:
   Upvalues in the needed functions. How to load without them?

After releasing a playable Outrider:
There'll be a lot of bug-fixing and balancing and updates to make, but I'd really like to take some time out to work on other stuff and expand my coding chops
  ☐ Create a ToME sketchpad / online forge where people can plan & share & template their addon class ideas
  ☐ A ToME Sublime package
  ☐ A ToME Dev addon featuring various tools
  ☐ Haskell course
  ☐ Try and get on Unix...? And learn the Unix tools, Perl (remember Perl? :D), practice with them a bit 
  ☐ Take a course or something on Linux command line so you can practice it.
  ☐ Study (groan!) git
