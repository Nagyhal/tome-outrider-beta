Coding resolutions:

○ Make use of 'assert'
○ Use modules and helper files, but know how Lua handles this
○ Learn about how debug, xpcall, etc. work and how to use them

Barks & howls!

How will they work?

• Beastmaster's Mark
• Wolf tracking ability

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDEAS ZONE: Maybe Challenge the Wilds beasts could run away when damaged / panicked?

Things not to forget:

• The Skykraken - tentacle tail, water spray, smash through terrain, steam
	(...maybe it can switch through a few different attacks based on a number of elemental drake classics)
• Animal Affinity as a prodigy? YES, could be - learn Beast Aspect and gain a bunch of buffs! Become a Beastlord!
• Disobedience for your Challenged animals
• Challenged mobs can also run away e.g. at 50% health--fight back the swarm!
• Special Arena mission leading to Skykraken showdown
• Capstones : Shatter and Unbridled Ferocity need to be just a bit beefier
• How to theme it if we put Mounted Archery into Beastmaster's Mark and also add missile slowing-down to Loose in the Saddle?
• Overrun could have a quick daze tacked on 
• Sickle-Hook Spear
• Horn-Bellied Bow
• Solar Knight class! And some kind of Cataphract!
• Ogre mounts : The hoar spider, mammoth & direwolf
• Halflings in treants can't shoot, treant moves slow but has root, fun had by all
• Mounted Archery should be an effect, and anyway
• Needs more Stamina gain, and Loyalty too... a "there, there!" where you pet your pet, provided you're safe and out of reach of enemy attacks? Maybe when you just stand still with your pet?
• Spring attack secondary effects - will it have a stronger melee component? It could be designed to incentivize you to expend mobility talents even a little more. Perhaps the melee strike will reduce their cooldown.
• Or, tie this into Feigned Retreat more. This would be good if Dreadful Onset were a generic category and Impalement were the tier 3 talent instead.
• Talk of which, a new generic category? For mounts, or...?

--------------------------------------------------------

What is needed for a "polish pass" on all known talents?

1) Tactical tables
2) Item egos
3) Pre-use etc.
4) range
5) is_melee
6) requires_target
7) speed
8) Does everything scale nicely?
	deactivate_on = {no_combat=true, run=true, rest=true},
	on_pre_use_ai
9) damDesc
10) no_npc_use

--------------------------------------------------------

Shader: Shield shatter!

MASTER OF BRUTALITY-multi-tiered passive approach

TL 1. Outrider also gains % damage from weapon mastery to bows
TL 2. 7% extra crit chance, up to 1 mental effect
TL 3. Your mount shares the bonus
TL 4. Up to 2 effects, +5%
TL 5. Up to 3, +5%, halved with arrows


uis[#uis+1] = {right=0, top=0, ui=ActorFrame.new{actor=self.npc.chat_display_entity or self.npc, w=64, h=64}}

--------------------------------------------------------
caring for your AI

imbue all talents with

requires_target
ai_level
a proper AI wants table
onAIGetTarget and on_pre_use_ai when needed
(call.lua has a good healing script)
drain_stamina for things like Mounted Archery

local within_range = target_dist and target_dist <= ((self:getTalentRange(t) or 0) + (self:getTalentRadius(t) or 0))
	^
	| 
   check that this is honest for all of your talents




----------------------------
Problems in the AI code;

aiSeeTargetPos:
canSee() can update a bit too harshly counter to stealth
a max_spread of 10 when the player teleports across the map is far too weak
"spreads" at line 275 is never previously referenced so it will always max at 1

_M.aiSubstDamtypes = {
		...
		if self:attr("warden_swap") then
			mh, oh = self.main_env.doWardenPreUse(self, "dual", true)
		end


Shock tactics

1/ Glorious Charge
2/ Shock and Awe
3/ Whirr of Blades
4/ Mounted Supremacy
  This could really just be a bonus to melee damage while mounted - see what you need
  Or shrug-off effects, that kind of thing (yes!)
-----------------------------

Bestial aspect

Now, this is an entirely new field. What do we want to have here? Nothing that will encroach too much upon any Werewolf-like classes, but... we could have something good. Let's see...

1/ Aspect of the Beast
	Take on some characteristics depending on your chosen beast; the wolf would gain... a bite attack, bleeding claws, dexterity and sensing
2/ Paw the Ground
	While dismounted, gain a jump attack similar to Savage Bound (could go in your Overrun slot...)
	(or you could just get to share Savage Bound when you use it, also a good idea)
	When dismounted, get a boost for a few turns (movement, defense, apr or something)
3/ Bestial Affinity
	Increase your abilities and your beast's abilities by a ratio of each other's
	at 3/5 : share an animal talent (e.g. Go For the Throat)
	at 5/5 : share Gruesome Depredation
4/ Primordial Howl
	a) Transform or b) Summmon 2 allied beasts

-----------------------------
Prodigy ideas

1/ Spirit Animal

Your animal is an immortal spirit that will follow you forever.

When hurt / killed it will enter spirit form and cause havoc on the battlefield

It will gain many passive defenses and spell immunities

It will also defend you from mental effects

You can teleport it (cooldown 20)

2/ Beastlord

Change to the Beastlord class, unlocking the Bestial Aspect category and increasing Bestial Dominion, Beast Heart to 1.50

Beasts you attack will leave calmly if you reduce them to 50% damage.

+50 Loyalty

You can rage at low loyalty, also removing your beast's disobediences and sending them into a rage

Bestial Aspect

	Take on some characteristics depending on your chosen beast; the wolf would gain... a bite attack, bleeding claws, dexterity and sensing
2/ Paw the Ground

	(or you could just get to share Savage Bound when you use it, also a good idea)

3/ Bestial Affinity

--------------------------------
Spider/ Save for Afters
Entangle one enemy in your spider web, while you engage with the main course. That foe heals to full and is paralyzed for minimum X turns, or until you attack it, but it is unable to attack or move for the duration. 
At level 3, leave a digestive poison in your victim's body that harms for X damage over X turns after wake-up.
At level 5, your spider can immobilize two targets!
