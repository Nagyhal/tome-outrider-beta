Coding resolutions:

○ Make use of 'assert'
○ Use modules and helper files, but know how Lua handles this
○ Learn about how debug, xpcall, etc. work and how to use them

IDEAS ZONE: Maybe Challenge the Wilds beasts could run away when damaged / panicked?

Things not to forget:

• The Skykraken - tentacle tail, water spray, smash through terrain, steam
	(...maybe it can switch through a few different attacks based on a number of elemental drake classics)
• Animal Affinity as a prodigy?
• Disobedience for your Challenged animals
• Challenged mobs can also run away e.g. at 50% health--fight back the swarm!
• Special Arena mission leading to Skykraken showdown
• Smash Defenses : we'll need to implement thats fully
• Need squelch noises for giblets throw 
• Capstones : Shatter and Unbridled Ferocity need to be just a bit beefier
		and maybe Rearing Assault. You could merge it with Smash!
• How to theme it if we put Mounted Archery into Beastmaster's Mark and also add missile slowing-down to Loose in the Saddle?
• Double fatigue for mounted talents
• Overrun could have a quick daze tacked on 
• Sickle-Hook Spear
• Horn-Bellied Bow
• Lance w/ Knightly (Glorious, whatever) Charge
• Solar Knight class! And some kind of Cataphract!
• Ogre mounts : The hoar spider, mammoth & direwolf
• Halflings in treants can't shoot, treant moves slow but has root, fun had by all
• Icons : Giblets for Gory Spectacle
• Think about Challenge the Wilds
• Spring Attack: A simple attack, ranged or melee, which switches to ranged, jumps back a square or two, and sets the Spring Attack bonus as currently implemented. THEN, you need some kind of indicator or feedback for the player so that they realize Spring Attack hits are indeed more powerful - but what can it be? A movement slow? Lost turns for the enemy on hit? Gained turns for the player? I dunno!
• Mounted Archery should be an effect, and anyway
• Needs more Stamina gain, and Loyalty too... a "there, there!" where you pet your pet, provided you're safe and out of reach of enemy attacks? Maybe when you just stand still with your pet?

What is needed for a "polish pass" on all known talents?

1) Tactical tables
2) Item egos
3) Pre-use etc.
4) range
5) is_melee
6) requires_target
7) speed
8) Does everything scale nicely?
	deactivate_on = {no_combat=true, run=true, rest=true},
	on_pre_use_ai
9) damDesc
10) no_npc_use

Shader: Shield shatter!

MASTER OF BRUTALITY-multi-tiered passive approach

TL 1. Outrider also gains % damage from weapon mastery to bows
TL 2. 7% extra crit chance, up to 1 mental effect
TL 3. Your mount shares the bonus
TL 4. Up to 2 effects, +5%
TL 5. Up to 3, +5%, halved with arrows


uis[#uis+1] = {right=0, top=0, ui=ActorFrame.new{actor=self.npc.chat_display_entity or self.npc, w=64, h=64}}

--------------------------------------------------------
caring for your AI

imbue all talents with

requires_target
ai_level
a proper AI wants table
onAIGetTarget and on_pre_use_ai when needed
(call.lua has a good healing script)
drain_stamina for things like Mounted Archery

local within_range = target_dist and target_dist <= ((self:getTalentRange(t) or 0) + (self:getTalentRadius(t) or 0))
	^
	| 
   check that this is honest for all of your talents




----------------------------
Problems in the AI code;

aiSeeTargetPos:
canSee() can update a bit too harshly counter to stealth
a max_spread of 10 when the player teleports across the map is far too weak
"spreads" at line 275 is never previously referenced so it will always max at 1

_M.aiSubstDamtypes = {
		...
		if self:attr("warden_swap") then
			mh, oh = self.main_env.doWardenPreUse(self, "dual", true)
		end
